## Research Overview ##
I have always been fascinated by research on computational mathematics and climate science. Although I am still deliberating about the likely topics/areas for my Ph.D., I am almost sure it will revolve around the aforemention subjects. My first exposure to climate science was at my alma mater, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), where I learned to use several computational tools to probe the climate system. Together with a few colleagues, we investigated the seasonal and annual rainfall characteristics in West Africa using tools such as python, the climate data operator (CDO), and bash.

To Culminate my masterâ€™s program, I studied the wind power density (WPD) over Africa based on ERA5. The essay was supervised by Prof. Lifeng Luo of Michigan State University. The project revolved around obtaining ERA5 10m (from the ground) wind speed over Africa and using them to extrapolate 100m speed. We applied several extrapolation techniques, such as the power law and the logarithmic methods. Since the power law estimates had better error characteristics, they were subsequently used to estimate the WPD over the continent. Furthermore, we also performed some trend analyses of WPD. The image below shows the seasonal trend in WPD over Africa based on ERA5 wind dataset from (1979 - 2021).
