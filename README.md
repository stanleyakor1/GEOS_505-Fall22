## Research Overview ##
I have always been fascinated by research on computational mathematics and climate science. Although I am still deliberating about the likely topics/areas for my Ph.D., I am almost sure it will revolve around the aforemention subjects. My first exposure to climate science was at my alma mater, the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), where I learned to use several computational tools to probe the climate system. Together with a few colleagues, we investigated the seasonal and annual rainfall characteristics in West Africa using tools such as python, the climate data operator (CDO), and bash.








## Goals for the Semester

1. Understanding software best practices
2. Improving my coding skills
3. Improving my team-work abilities
